    "This is a combination of the OSEMN method explained at:[insert link here] and the CRISP-DM method explained at:[insert line here]. I found that the OSEMN method explained the data science process, but did not provide a framework for contextualization of the model or original data; whereas, the CRISP-DM method provided the business understanding and deployment steps to handle defining the scope of a project. I found the descriptors in the CRISP-DM method for projects did not specify obtaining or cleaning the data, which is where the OSEMN method shines. Both methods have strengths and weakness; as a result, I decided to pull the details from both to enrich my project building experience and to always keep the client in mind by expanding on the steps of both methodologies."
